          <p> The goal was to create a a video-game for a public exhibition. For the making of this video-game they had to put us in big groups and each team was divided in Programming, Design, Art and Archigraphy. I was in the archigraphy group. My goal was to make every physical thing of the video-game. That included: sensors, creating all the physical environment were the video-game was going to be (scenography), recreating the physical version of the logo, etc.
            This was an exhausting but gratifying project. It took some stressful moments due to the short time they gave us, but with respect, responsibility, cooperation and imagination we could make it.
            Besides all the things I learn from all those areas I mentioned. It taught me how to work with a huge team, in spite our differences. </p>
